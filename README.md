# Clinic Management System

This is a comprehensive clinic management system that allows you to efficiently manage patient records, doctor information, appointments, medical records, prescriptions, and payments. The system is built using C# with .NET Framework, Ms SQL Server for the database, ADO.NET for data access, and WinForms for the desktop interface. It follows a three-tier architecture consisting of the Data Access Layer, Business Layer, and Presentation Layer.

## Features

### 1. Patients

The system stores detailed information about patients. Each patient is assigned a unique identifier, and their profile includes their name, date of birth, gender, contact information (phone number, email), and address.

### 2. Doctors

The system maintains a comprehensive database of doctors. Each doctor is assigned a unique identifier, and their profile includes their name, specialization, date of birth, gender, contact information (phone number, email), and address.

### 3. Appointments

The system manages appointments effectively. Each appointment is assigned a unique identifier and includes the patient, doctor, appointment date and time, and appointment status. Appointment statuses include:
- Pending: The appointment has been scheduled but has not yet occurred.
- Confirmed: The appointment has been confirmed by both the patient and the healthcare provider.
- Completed: The appointment has taken place as scheduled.
- Canceled: The appointment has been canceled either by the patient or the healthcare provider.
- Rescheduled: The appointment has been rescheduled for a different date or time.
- No Show: The patient did not show up for the appointment without canceling or rescheduling.

### 4. Medical Records

The system maintains comprehensive medical records for patients. Each attended appointment is associated with a medical record. Each medical record is assigned a unique identifier and includes the patient, doctor, description of the visit, diagnosis, prescribed medication, and any additional notes.

### 5. Prescription

The system manages prescribed medications efficiently. For each medical record, there can be at most one prescription. Each prescription is assigned a unique identifier and includes the medical record, medication name, dosage, frequency, start date, end date, and any special instructions.

### 6. Payments

The system tracks payment information for appointments. Each payment is assigned a unique identifier and includes the patient, payment date, payment method, amount paid, and any additional notes. Payments are associated with individual appointments.
